	abstract = {An investigation is made of the merits of various emission-line intensity ratios for classifying the spectra of extragalactic objects. It is shown empirically that several combinations of easily-measured lines can be used to separate objects into one of four categories according to the principal excitation mechanism: normal H II regions, planetary nebulae, objects photoionized by a power-law continuum, and objects excited by shock-wave heating. A two-dimensional quantitative classification scheme is suggested.}

To this end, we use the Duplancic et al. catalogue of small galaxy systems and consider BPT and WHAN diagnostic diagrams to select optical AGNs. Also, we identify mid-IR AGNs by using WISE data. We performed a comparison between the different AGN classification methodologies and study the AGN fraction in pairs, triplets, and groups with four to six members. We also analyse the main properties of Optical and mid-IR AGN hosts and the influence of environment on the active nuclei phenomena in these small galaxy systems. Our results show that, regardless the specifically adopted classification scheme, the fraction of AGN in pairs and triplets is always higher than the corresponding fraction in groups. Moreover, the fraction of powerful AGNs in pair and triplets is about twice the fraction of regular AGNs. We also find a remarkable difference between Optical and mid-IR AGNs in groups, where host galaxies of WISE AGNs are less massive and concentrated, with young stellar populations and blue colours. Also, all WISE AGNs in groups have a very close companions and reside in an intermediate global density environment. Galaxy triplets show a larger AGN fraction for galaxies with a close nearest neighbours, while pairs present a nearly constant AGN fraction regardless the distance to the nearest companion. Our studies highlight the important role of interactions, besides the global environment dependence, in the activation of the AGN phenomenon in small galaxy systems.}",

	title = {Hidden AGNs in Dwarf Galaxies Revealed by MaNGA: Light Echoes, Off-nuclear Wanderers, and a New Broad-line AGN},
	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal Letters},
	abstract = {Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in dwarf galaxies could host the relics of those early universe seed black holes that did not grow into supermassive black holes. Using MaNGA integral field unit (IFU) spectroscopy we have found a sample of 37 dwarf galaxies that show AGN ionization signatures in spatially resolved emission line diagnostic diagrams. The AGN signatures are largely missed by integrated emission line diagnostics for 23 of them. The bolometric luminosity of these 23 new AGN candidates is ≲1040 erg s−1, fainter than that of single-fiber SDSS AGNs, X-ray AGNs, and radio AGNs in dwarf galaxies, which supports IFU spectroscopy as a powerful tool for identifying hidden and faint AGNs in dwarf galaxies. The AGN emission is in most cases offset from the optical center of the dwarf galaxy and shows a symmetric morphology, which indicates that either the AGNs are off-nuclear, that the central emission of the galaxy is dominated by star formation, or that the AGNs are turned off and we are observing a past ionization burst. One of the new AGNs shows a broad Hα emission line component, from which we derive a black hole mass in the realm of intermediate-mass black holes. This constitutes the first hidden type 1 AGN discovered in a dwarf galaxy based on IFU spectroscopy. The finding of this sample of hidden and faint AGNs has important implications for population studies of AGNs in dwarf galaxies and for seed black hole formation models.}
